Problem Statement
In the file above, rankings are given for various football teams.

% Write a script to ask the user for the filename.  

read the ranking for the Eagles and the Cardinals from the file

write their ranking into a new file.  

Prompt the user for the filename of this new file.  

The new file should look like this:

Eagles:  596
Cardinals:  -7153

I will test your program using a file having secret numbers.  However,
you may assume that the teams are given in the same order as above.  This
means that the Eagles are guaranteed to be on line 3 and the Cardinals
are guaranteed to be on line 8.
