Write a script called board_problem_reader.m.
The script should prompt the user for the filename
of the file written by board_problem.m, the
script we analyzed in class.  The script should
open the file and read its contents into variable A,
then write A to the screen using fprintf.  The matrix
should be stored and displayed on the screen using the same
numbers of rows and columns as it has on disk.

Here's a screen shot of my program:

>> board_problem_reader
Input filename : outputfile.txt
9 3 6
1 6 5
0 1 8
2 0 5
>>
