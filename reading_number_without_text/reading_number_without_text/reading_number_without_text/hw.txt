Problem Statement
In the file above, rankings are given for various football teams.
Write a script to ask the user for the filename.  Then read
the ranking for the Eagles and the Cardinals from the file, writing
their ranking into a new file.  Prompt the user for the filename
of this new file.  The new file should look like this:

Eagles:  596
Cardinals:  -7153

I will test your program using a file having secret numbers.  However,
you may assume that the teams are given in the same order as above.  This
means that the Eagles are guaranteed to be on line 3 and the Cardinals
are guaranteed to be on line 8.
